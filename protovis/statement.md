These [uncertain times]( are a )*free pass to be unsure*, and to marinate in it until it becomes a form of *confidence through vulnerability*. Not knowing what I'm doing is 
* [an open call to dive in]() &
* [to trust that I know how to swim;]()
* [to find and nurture confidence]() and excitement through [wandering & building *with others*]().

I want the guts to [not be afraid]( of )*getting lost* & the wisdom to know *there are no wrong directions*, and I want somehow to take this towards helping people 
* understand, then
* appreciate, then
* celebrate
complexity in intuitive ways.
