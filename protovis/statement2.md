Not knowing what I'm doing is

- `an open call to dive in` &
- `to trust that I know how to swim`.

I want the guts to [not be afraid]( of )_getting lost_ & the wisdom to know _there are no wrong directions_, and I want somehow to take this towards helping people

- `understand`, then
- `appreciate`, then
- `celebrate`
  complexity in intuitive ways.

It's all about a executing a _controlled fall_: to

- [fall]( and take a step to catch myself, )
- [reorient]( , )
- [take in the surroundings]( , and to )
- [fall again]( : )
  1. falling _sometimes towards_ the goals I've set, and
  2. _sometimes away_, but
  3. always stopping to
     a. take in the way things have changed and
     b. the way things have stayed the same.
